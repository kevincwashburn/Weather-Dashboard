# Weather-Dashboard

This repository contains a web-based weather dashboard that allows the user to type in the name of a city and get real-time weather information of that city. Each city that is entered is displayed on the right-hand side of the page that shows the current date, a weather icon showing the current weather conditions, as well as the current temperature in fahrenheit, humidity level, and wind speed. Each additional city is displayed below the previous one.
